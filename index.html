<p>     I live in Corpus Christi, TX. Home of Selena, great Mexican food, and beautiful beaches. 
        I was born and raised here. I went to Moody High School, and moved to San Antonio when I turned 18. 
        I attended UTSA, where I attained my BA in Communications.  I spent 12 fun years in the Alamo City. 
        I moved back to Corpus about 4 years ago to be closer to my family. I recently got married to a wonderful man I have known since I was about 14 years old.
        We have two dogs and a cat. We just found our 2nd dog in San Antonio. In all honesty, we weren't wanting another pet, but she has made a home with us... and quite
        frankly, we are suckers. 
        <br>

        <br>
            As far as my career goes, I have a very boring job working in Career Services. All joking aside, it has been a great experience working with the students. I feel I have learned all I can learn in my current
        role, so I feel complacent. My newest venture for 2020 is to take this Web Development class so that I can learn 
        Front End Development and start a new career in something more challenging and hopefully fun and higher paying!
        My current company doesn't seem to like to give big raises.. and thats a problem for me and my pocket book. (Insert smiley face here)
         <br>

        <br>

        What can I say.. I am at an age and a point in my life where I want to do more, and have the ability to work in a field I have always
        been interested in. I am blessed with a great life, I am happy, and highly favored. This is an investment in myself, my husband, and our future children.
